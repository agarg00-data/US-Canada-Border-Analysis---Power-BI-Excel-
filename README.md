🌎📊 Border Insights Through Data: US-Canada vs US-Mexico 📊🌎
Thrilled to share a recent dashboard project analyzing cross-border transportation trends across the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders. This visualization was designed to uncover patterns in how people and goods move across two of the most important international gateways in North America.
🎯 Highlights from the Analysis:
The US-Mexico border sees significantly higher movement in categories like pedestrians and buses, with San Ysidro and El Paso being major ports.
Personal vehicle passengers make up the largest segment across both borders, contributing over 6.3 billion in value.
There is a clear seasonal trend in cross-border movement, and a notable dip in 2020 reflects the impact of global events like COVID-19.
A map-based heat visualization helps track transportation volumes geographically.
📌 This project allowed me to work on:
 ✔️ Data cleaning and modeling
 ✔️ Visual storytelling using Power BI
 ✔️ Drawing insights across time, state, and transportation types
 ✔️ Enhancing interactive dashboard experience for non-technical stakeholders
This kind of analysis can help inform public policy, border infrastructure planning, and supply chain logistics with evidence-based decisions.
🛠 Tools used: Power BI, data modeling, interactive visuals, and transportation datasets.
Would love to connect with professionals working in transportation analytics, public sector data, or cross-border logistics!
